## Technologies Used

*Bullet point tech used- html, css, javascript & github

*Where and how it was used- html for giving the body to the structure. css to style that structure. javascript to give some brains to the structure so that it can do stuff on its own and finally github to store and update all the information related to the structure online

*Biggest achievements- got the hang of these Technologies and now understand the difference between them

*Toughest problem so far- to get the loops to work in html file using css styling
